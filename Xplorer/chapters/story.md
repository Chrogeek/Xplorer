# Chapter 0: Welcome to Xplorer (Included, Tutorial)

# Chapter 1: Departure (Included)

In the year 9102, humans have confirmed the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

EASA (Earth Aeronautics and Space Administration) have decided to launch the manned Parker Milky Way Probe for further investigation.

And, their final goal is to get in touch with the exotic world.

You have volunteered to take the probe and go on this great xploration.

On a sunny day in November, you set off for the spaceport, starting your journey into the Deep Dark Universe...

## Level 1: Astounding Desert

After a long journey, you are at the EASA spaceport, located in a faraway desert in Entarktica.

'Wow!'

Here in the heart of the land, man is battling against distances. The spaceport staff are preparing for the most complicated yet ambitious xploration mission ever.

You - the volunteer - will soon get on the probe, to meet the exotic intelligence,
on Behalf of the Whole Mankind!

## Level 2: The Solar View

The probe has already been launched. It's indeed thrilling to experience such a great human activity.

- 'Where am I?'
- You are already out of the Earth atmosphere.

Outside of the window is the fantastic view of the sun...

## Level 3: Arrival

Later, you felt asleep. That's because you took the sleeping pills from the experts on Earth.

When you wake up again, it's already half a year. No, according to Einstein, it should be a million years!

The probe is decelerating - you are going to land on your first destination.

# Chapter 3: The Dhosey (Excluded)

# Chapter 4: The Khaiocey (Included)

Now you are at Khaiocey, a planet of the FOP-PA18 Galaxy.

This is your third destination, and when you finish the mission on this planet, you will return to the Earth.

FOP-PA18 is an especially attracing galaxy. Its center star, Taiyoh, is very similar to our Sun in many aspects: chemical composition, mass, volume, temperature. Among Taiyoh's planets, Khaiocey is a relatively suitable one for organisms - and scientists indeed confirmed the existence of live there.

## Level 1: Hi Khaiocey

Mayday, mayday. Danger!

It seems that there's something inaccurate with the data from Earth. Atmospheric oxygen concentration is too low for you to survive!

But you have been already well prepared. With enough protection, you step out of the traveller...

## Level 2: Research @ Khaiocey

To your disappointment, you met no intelligent creature on the first day at Khaiocey.

However, you have collected much rocks and minerals from the planet.

Okay, now it's time to work on them.

## Level 3: The Last Day of Xploration

Your mission is completed. You visited three exotic galaxies, met the little green men on Dhosey, performed meaningful research on Khaiocey, and kept a detailed diary of your travel.

Dashboard on the probe shows that you should set off back to Earth now.

Although nostalgic, you leave the Khaiocey and head for Earth 100 thousand lightyears away.
